# DP-Tutorial
Data Product Tutorial Project based on developing a simple, web-based application for language detection.
Using Wikipedia as an initial training corpus - create a model that classifies language using a simple bag-of-words model and a Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes classifier.  Then create a simple web application that will use the model to guess the language that someone types on the screen. The tutorial will follow each phase of the data science pipeline including ingest, wrangle, compute, and visualize.
